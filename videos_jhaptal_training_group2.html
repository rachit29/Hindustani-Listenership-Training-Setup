      <h1><b>Jhaptal Rhythm Training Videos for Group 2</b></h1>
      <p> Jhaptal is another tala of Hindustani music. It presents quite a different rhythmical structure from Tintal (which you heard in the first session), unlike which it is not symmetrical.</p>
      Jhaptal has a 10-beat pattern. It has ten beats in four divisions, of 2-3-2-3, the third of which is the khali, or open division. 
      <p>
      <p>>>>>> Here are the videos of Jhaptal with beat pattern represented in a cycle. Please try to follow the beat pattern and understand its structure.
      
      <p>IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that the goal is to find the "Sam" which is represented by <b>"Dhin"</b> on the top of rhythm circle. Try to learn the timing of the repeating "Sam".
